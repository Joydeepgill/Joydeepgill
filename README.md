### Hi there 👋

 I'm a Computer Science Undergraduate from the University of Ottawa 🇨🇦 and am currently interested in Database Systems, OS, Compilers and Low level systems 💻 . Previously, I've interned at the following companies:   

- University of Ottawa (Frontend Devlopment)
- Phreesia (Backend Development)
- PointClickCare (Backend Development) 

Currently I'm working on some cool things, which include: 
 
- 🔭 I’m currently working on doing data structures and algorithms puzzles
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ 
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her

When I'm not doing anything CS related, you catch me reading a cool webtoon, watching a cute k-drama, or playing with my dog 🐶.

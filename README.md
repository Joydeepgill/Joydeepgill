### Hi there 👋

 I'm a Computer Science Undergraduate from the University of Ottawa 🇨🇦 and am currently interested in Database systems, OS, Compilers and Low level systems 💻 . Preiovusly, I've interned at 3 different companies, where I worked in Frontend and Backend Development. 
 
- 🔭 I’m currently working on doing DS/Algo puzzles
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ 
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her

When I'm not doing anything CS related, you catch me reading a cool webtoon, watching a cute k-drama, or playing with my dog 🐶

### Hi there 👋

 I'm a Software Developer and am currently interested in OS, Compilers and Low level systems 💻 . Previously, I've worked at the following companies:   
 
- University of Ottawa (Frontend Devlopment)
- Phreesia (Backend Development)
- PointClickCare (Backend Development) 

Currently I'm working on some cool things, which include: 
 
- 🔭 working on doing data structures and algorithms puzzles
- 🌱 learning C++  


When I'm not doing anything CS related, you catch me reading a cool webtoon, watching a cute k-drama, or playing with my dog 🐶.
